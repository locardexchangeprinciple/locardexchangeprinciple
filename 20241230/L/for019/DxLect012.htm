        <section>
            <h2>Introduction to Incident Response</h2>
            <p>Incident response (IR) refers to the structured approach used to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. The goal of incident response is to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of security breaches or attacks. Incident response involves identifying the signs of an attack, containing the incident to prevent further damage, and taking the necessary steps to recover from the breach while preserving evidence for further analysis.</p>
            <p>Effective incident response is critical to minimizing damage, preventing future attacks, and ensuring business continuity. It requires the coordination of multiple teams, including IT, legal, communications, and security professionals, to address the incident efficiently and protect sensitive data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Incident Response Phases</h2>
            <p>Incident response typically follows a series of stages that help structure the process of managing a security incident. These stages are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Preparation:</span> This phase involves creating an incident response plan, establishing teams, setting up tools, and training employees to identify potential security incidents.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Identification:</span> Detecting signs of a security incident, such as suspicious activities, anomalies, or system alerts, that suggest a potential breach or cyber attack.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Containment:</span> Once the incident is identified, containment strategies are implemented to limit the scope and prevent further damage, such as isolating affected systems or blocking malicious network traffic.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Eradication:</span> After containment, the root cause of the incident is identified and removed from the system, including deleting malicious files, closing vulnerabilities, and ensuring the threat is fully eliminated.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Recovery:</span> This phase focuses on restoring affected systems to normal operation while ensuring no remnants of the attack remain. Recovery efforts may involve system restoration, patching vulnerabilities, and monitoring for signs of re-infection.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Lessons Learned:</span> Once the incident is resolved, a post-incident analysis is conducted to evaluate the response process, identify areas of improvement, and update the incident response plan to better prepare for future threats.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)</h2>
            <p>Cyber Threat Intelligence refers to the process of gathering and analyzing information about potential or current cyber threats to an organization. CTI helps security teams understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries, allowing organizations to proactively defend against cyber threats.</p>
            <p>CTI plays a key role in enhancing the ability to detect and respond to cyber threats in real time. By understanding the behavior of cybercriminals and threat actors, organizations can adjust their defenses to better protect sensitive data, networks, and systems from future attacks.</p>
