        <section>
            <h2>What is the Radix System?</h2>
            <p>The Radix system, also known as the base system, is a way to express numbers in different numeral systems. Each numeral system has a base (or radix), which determines the number of unique digits, including zero, that can be used to represent numbers.</p>
            <p>For example, the decimal system uses base 10, meaning it has ten digits (0 to 9), while the binary system uses base 2, meaning it has only two digits (0 and 1). Similarly, the hexadecimal system uses base 16, which includes digits 0-9 and letters A-F.</p>
            <p>In cryptography, these numeral systems are used extensively for encoding, hashing, and encrypting information. Understanding how to convert between different bases is crucial for working with encryption algorithms and networking protocols like IPv6.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Binary System (Base 2)</h2>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">binary system</span> is a base-2 numeral system, which means it uses only two digits: <span class="highlight">0</span> and <span class="highlight">1</span>. In binary, all numbers are represented using combinations of these two digits.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses in Cryptography:</strong> Binary is fundamental to digital systems because computers process data in binary. Every file, image, or application on a computer is stored as binary data (1s and 0s). In encryption algorithms, binary values are used for operations like XOR, AND, or shifting bits.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The binary representation of the decimal number 13 is <span class="highlight">1101</span>. You can see how binary is used for representing values in computing.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Decimal 13 = Binary 1101</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Binary in IPv6</h3>
            <p>In IPv6 addresses, binary is used to represent the address in a more readable hexadecimal form. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, and each group of 4 bits (a nibble) corresponds to a hexadecimal digit.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</pre>
                <pre>Binary: 001000000000000100001101101110000000100001011000001110110000000000000000000010001010101110100000011100110011010001110100110100</pre>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Decimal System (Base 10)</h2>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">decimal system</span> is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is also known as the base-10 system, as it is based on 10 symbols (0-9).</p>
            <p><strong>Uses in Cryptography:</strong> Decimal is less directly used in encryption algorithms but is essential for human-readable representations of data, addresses, and encrypted results. It's used in key sizes (e.g., 256-bit keys) and hash function outputs (e.g., SHA-256), where the final output can be converted into decimal for easier comprehension.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The decimal number 35 is written as <span class="highlight">35</span> in decimal.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Decimal 35 = Decimal 35</pre>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Hexadecimal System (Base 16)</h2>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">hexadecimal system</span> is a base-16 numeral system, which uses 16 digits: <span class="highlight">0-9</span> and <span class="highlight">A-F</span>. The digits <span class="highlight">A</span> to <span class="highlight">F</span> represent the decimal values 10 to 15.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses in Cryptography:</strong> Hexadecimal is often used in cryptographic applications because it provides a more compact way to represent binary data. In hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256, the resulting output is often expressed in hexadecimal form for readability.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The binary number <span class="highlight">1101</span> is represented as <span class="highlight">D</span> in hexadecimal. Similarly, the binary number <span class="highlight">101010</span> is represented as <span class="highlight">2A</span> in hexadecimal.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Binary 1101 = Hexadecimal D</pre>
                <pre>Binary 101010 = Hexadecimal 2A</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Hexadecimal in Encryption Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Hexadecimal is frequently used in hashing and encryption algorithms because it reduces the size of large binary numbers. For instance, the output of the SHA-256 hash function is typically shown in hexadecimal format.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> SHA-256 hash of the string "Hello" is:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>SHA-256("Hello") = 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b171c7b5a3b1f60b788041f1c4f8de7</pre>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Steps for Conversion Between Radix Systems</h2>
            <p>Converting numbers between different radix systems is essential in cryptography, especially for tasks like key generation, hashing, and network protocols like IPv6.</p>

            <h3>Binary to Decimal Conversion</h3>
            <p>To convert from binary to decimal, multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 for the rightmost bit) and sum the results.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Binary: 1101</pre>
                <pre>Decimal: (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Decimal to Binary Conversion</h3>
            <p>To convert from decimal to binary, divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0. The binary number is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Decimal: 13</pre>
                <pre>Binary: 1101</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion</h3>
            <p>Group the binary number into sets of 4 bits, starting from the right. Convert each 4-bit group into a hexadecimal digit.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>Binary: 1101</pre>
                <pre>Hexadecimal: D</pre>
            </div>
